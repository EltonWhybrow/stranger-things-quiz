# Stranger Things Fandom Quiz
## About
Simple Stranger Things quiz and game. Test you ST fandom. Find out more on [here](https://eltonwhybrow.github.io/stranger-things-quiz/about)

## How to play
Once you get to the [quiz](https://eltonwhybrow.github.io/stranger-things-quiz/quiz) page you have the chance to prove your fandom by answering questions on season 1-4 of Stranger Things. You will NOT find out your score untill the end, so you will have to be a real fan to get all correct (without cheating , that is!)

You can get a little refresher on the main characters by going to the [characters](https://eltonwhybrow.github.io/stranger-things-quiz/characters) view, but if you're a real fan you shouldn't need to do that.

If you do manage to get all questions correct, you get the chance to play an added `bonus game` as a reward!
